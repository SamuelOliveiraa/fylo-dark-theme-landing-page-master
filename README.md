The site gives us the possibility to train any skill or web technology that we want, be it media-querie, grid layout, Jquery, React, etc..

## The Challenge ðŸŽ¯

This challenge is to reproduce this **Fylo dark theme landing page** as close as possible to the original design.

[    FALAR AS DIFICULDADES QUE TIVE NO DESAFIO             ]
My biggest difficulties in this challenge were centering the div with the container-2 class, as I wasn't managing to align to the center in the "traditional" ways, so I used the flex display and managed to align all the elements. 

My other difficulty was to put this white background on Victor's image, my solution for that was to wrap the image in a div with a white background and adjust it with the position absolute
